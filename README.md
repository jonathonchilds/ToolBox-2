# ToolBox

Herein lies my capstone application: Toolbox!

This is a gig-economy platform wherein users may borrow, rent, or buy tools.
Users may also offer their own tools up for borrowing, renting, or purchasing!

This app has been lovingly created by me, with a C#/.net backend, and a Typescript, React, & Tailwind front end.
