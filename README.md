# ToolBox

Herein lies my capstone application: Toolbox.

It's a fully-functional fullstack application* allowing users to sign up and sign in, then create, read, update and delete tools from a PostgreSQL database.

Various features are made available according to authentication status.

I built my backend API and user sessions with C# & .NET, and I utilized TypeScript, React, and Tailwind for the frontend.

Feel free to sign up, sign in, and look around!

*Note: I built the entirety of the app including all of the forms & components, from scratch!_
