# ToolBox

ToolBox is my capstone application - my final project from my bootcamp. 
It's a full stack application, for which I created every aspect - from the UI, to the API, to the PostgreSQL (SQL) database.
Heavy use of TypeScript, React, CSS 3, Tailwind CSS, C#, .NET Framework, .NET Core, Entity Framework
